MLlib
=====

This is a java library contains machine learning algorithms, structures and evaluation methods. I am implementing these codes for getting deep insight about these algorithms, as well as the whole machine learning worlds.

Sorry for that I can not provide any guarantee on the correctness and completeness of these codes. 

Any suggestion and bug report is welcome. Feel free to read and comment on it!
